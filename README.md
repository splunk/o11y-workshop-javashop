# Learn how Splunk APM reduces Repair Times for development teams with Custom Tags.

## Hands on Workshop Scenario

Here at Splunk Instruments, our business is expanding!

We have recently added 3 new locations: Two locations in the USA (Colorado and Chicago) and one international location in Sri Lanka. 

Our technical staff has already on-boarded the data from these new locations and incorporated them into our inventory application and it is our job to review these improvements and send any issues back to our developers for repairs.

We now have a total of 6 locations !

# Build and Deploy Application

Let's get started by building and deploying our Application, the Splunk Instrument Shop. Run the commands below to begin and start reading ahead as your traces are coming up !

- Build the app
```
./BuildAndDeploy.sh
```

# Users and Workflows
	
As we go through this workshop we will be switching roles from SRE to Developer. First we will start with alert responders or SREs who will identify an issue in Splunk Observability UI. Next, we will jump to a Developer Role to see how a Developer will debug and repair/fix a software problem using trace data provided by our SRE.

Of course, we are not requiring 2 people for this workshop as each participant will play both roles.

# Today we will learn 

Today we will learn how Splunk APM with Full Fidelity tracing can accelerate the time to repair for Development teams. We will focus on the full fidelity data ( In the form of traces ) that an SRE or alert responder would send to a developer to then repair/fix software. We will do this with both Auto-Instrumentation data and Custom attributes or Custom Tags, via Manual Instrumentation data.

While we will be spending time Debugging code, .... Don't worry, ...there is no programming experience necessary, as our goal here is for every participant to understand how using Custom Attributes/Tags in Splunk APM @ Full Fidelity accelerates Mean Time to Repair Software problems for Development Teams.

# Let's define a few terms for those new to APM / Software Development or Java

1. **What Are Custom Attributes / Custom Tags in Splunk APM ?**
	
	First, you will hear poeple refer to Custom Attributes in the context of Splunk Enterprise, however in Splunk APM Custom Attributes are called 	    	  	Custom Tags as defined in Opentelemetry and shown in Splunk APM Tag Splotlight. 
	
2. **What is a Function  or a method in Java?**

	A Function  in most languages includeing Java, is a logical chunk of code when executed solves a repeatable task. This is basically what development teams 		spend thier time building and where software issues will most commonly be.
	
3. **What is an Exception in Java?**

	An Exceptional error condition that indicates abonormal or unhandled condition, that interrupts program execution abnormally.
	
# View Service Map

Next step is open your Observability UI, accessing the proper org ( where you sent the traces to ) and click APM and Access the Environemnnt that matches the username you put in .env

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/229945586-bd379517-8381-410a-9f70-36542fe0b03d.png)


Please note it may take 4-5 minutes or more for traces to show up and you will see full map "form" as traces are coming in, so you may have to refresh the page a few times each time we Build and Deploy. 
 
It is recommended to use a -15m look back during this lab. You may need to change it from time to time (for example to -5m or a custom -10m) to make sure you are only looking at the newer traces after your changes.

NOTE: You may have to refresh the page several times to see your Environment Tag in the UI. The prefix of the Environment tag should match what you entered for SHOP_USER in the .env file.


<img width="731" alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-14 at 8 25 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/219972238-36a91449-119b-4ce9-ba3c-d5ea354a8aeb.png">


NOTE: Typically, to identify root cause and route an issue, an SRE or alert responder would check metrics and logs to determine if it is a software or hardware related issue, and thus route to the correct party. In this excercise we are ONLY handling software issues, so we are skipping the metrics and logs parts of normal triage. 

If your instrumentation was successful, the service-map will show latency from the shop service to the products service. 

![Screen Shot 2022-12-08 at 11 48 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/206541846-7f0e6462-7659-44bc-bc48-3621c2872fc4.png)

Ok let's triage this SOFTWARE ISSUE and skip directly to the traces.

- Click on `shop` service
- Click **Traces** ( on the right side ) 
- Sort by Duration
- Select the longest duration trace ( or one of the obvious much longer ones ) 

![LongTrace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204347798-4f232b7f-7a7a-483f-9d61-f0b535e9ecf0.png)

Now we can see the long latency occurred in the products service and if we click on products: /products
we can see the offending method was products:ProductResource.getAllProducts
÷≥«
![long-trace-detail-GetAllProducts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204347855-724545bf-c3df-478a-a27d-e4f85f708e15.png)

Our next step here would be to send that trace to a developer by clicking download trace and
they will have to debug the function. Since we will be the developer there is no need to download the trace. Just remember that is normal workflow for alert responders to route an issue to the "Repairers" while providing trace data. 

Before we do that please take note of the Tags available for the developer to leverage to find root cause. We see standard out of the box Otel tags on the span, environmental information, but no indcations of data specific to something inside custom code ( which is where the problem always is. )

# Now let's play the role of the developer

As a developer we must debug the function products:ProductResource.getAllProducts to find the problem.


# Debugging 101, the Line by Line method

Without anything to go on other than "BAD FUNCTION", a Developer must then look at code visually line by line to find and fix the problem. To make this worse, Functions, call Functions and it can get very messy in bad code scenarios.

We will do the visual inspection mehtod next.

- Using Nano:
```
nano products/src/main/java/com/shabushabu/javashop/products/resources/ProductResource.java
```

- Search in Nano: `[CTRL]-w`
- Enter in: `getAllProducts` **[Enter]**

```
  @GET
    public Response getAllProducts(@DefaultValue("California") @QueryParam("location") String location) {
    	  
    	// STEP X: All we know right now is somewhere in this function, latency was introduced.
  
    	myCoolFunction1(location);
    	myCoolFunction2(location);
    	myCoolFunction10(location);
    	myCoolFunction13(location);
    	myCoolFunction5(location);
    	myCoolFunction6(location);
 ```


We can see here in getAllProducts, the first call is to `myCoolFunction1()`, so as may have guessed our next step is to go look at `myCoolFunction1()`.

- Search in Nano: `[CTRL]-w`
- Enter in: `myCoolFunction1` **[Enter]**
- Find the next occurrence: `[CTRL]-w` **[Enter]**
- Keep repeating `[CTRL]-w` **[Enter]** until you get to the actual function definition

It looks like this:

```
private void myCoolFunction1(String location) {
      // Generate a FAST sleep of 0 time !
      int sleepy = lookupLocation1(location);
      try{
      Thread.sleep(sleepy);

      } catch (Exception e){

      }
    }
```    
Now, `myCoolFunction1` calls `lookupLocation1(location)`

- Search in Nano: `[CTRL]-w`
- Enter in: `lookupLocation1` **[Enter]**

I think you get the picture by now, you have no choice but to inspect every line of code and every function called and visually inspect them for problems. This can be a VERY long process and kills our customers Mean Time to Repair. This happens quite often to our customers with our competition beacsue they can't provide all the traces 100% of the time and most can't scale to add more data, via Custom Attributes on top of that!

Remember, without Full Fidelty, you have to either reproduce errors / latency in another environment or inspect code line by line.

So they are stuck where we are, quite often.

OK, enough fun ..let's make this easier for our developer... and show off some Splunk APM Scale!

Ok exit your editor:

- Exit nano: `[CTRL]-X`
  - **Optional**: If it asks you to save, hit `N`

# Custom Attribution ( Custom Tags )

To take a deeper look at this issue and make this much easier to debug we will implement Custom Attributes via Opentelemetry Manual Instrumentation.

To speed up manual instrumentation in Java you can leverage [OpenTelemetry Annotations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/annotations/ ), which automatically create a span around a method without modifying the actual code inside the method. This can be very valuable if you are working with an SRE that may have limited access to source code changes.

To add even more information to help our developers find the root cause faster,
[OpenTelemetry Annotations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/annotations/ ) can be used to generate span tags with parameter values for the method in question. This is incredibly important to mean time to Repair, because as a Developer, if I know the parameter values of a function at the time of latency or error, I can debug this without having to reproduce an issue in another environment if I have Full Fidelity Tracing.

Splunk Full Fidelity APM allows our customers development teams to debug their code as it ran in production, 100% of the time . Add with Custom Attribution, you are providing repeatable Mean Time to Repair reduction...  100% of the time, only with Full Fidelity tracing.
 
To expedite manual instrumentation implementation for this exercise, we have provided a tool which will annotate the entirety of the "shop" and "products" services with OpenTelemetry standard annotations for every function call without having to write any code. This "annotator" tool will also tag every parameter in every function, which adds a span tag with `Parameter=Value`. 

# Run Manual Instrumentation Tool

- Run:
```
./AutomateManualInstrumentation.sh
```

# Rebuild and Deploy Application

- Run:
```
./BuildAndDeploy.sh
```

# Now that we have rebuilt and deployed our application, traffic is being sent once again.

Go back to the Splunk Observability UI and let's see if these annotations help us narrow down the root cause more quickly.

Let's try to find our latency root cause again, this time with every function and every parameter spanned and tagged respectively.... You will see exactly what this means and how it benefits developers in a moment...

![Screen Shot 2022-12-08 at 11 48 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/206541846-7f0e6462-7659-44bc-bc48-3621c2872fc4.png)


- Click on `shop` service
- Click **Traces** ( on the right side ) 
- Sort by Duration
- Select the longest duration trace ( or one of the obvious much longer ones ) 

![213582624-66466a19-00fa-4dda-acd0-f6970d594ba1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/219955286-f55cfc0e-3936-45be-ac95-3c4b547f2007.png)
	
We can see that the actual function call that has the latency was not ProductResource.getAllProducts but 
the function call "ProductResource.myCoolFunction234234234" !

Since we now have the parameter tagged as part of our span metadata the actual root cause is seemingly related to the  "location" Colorado ! And it appears the one custom attribute that was tagged for function "ProductResource.myCoolFunction234234234" was "myInt" with a value of 999. With this information a Developer can debug very quickly. 

NOTE: We added additional span information, which we call "Custom Attributes" here at Splunk, in this case our "Custom Attributes" are "Parameter Values at Time of Latency". 

In our exmaple  the "myInt" tag was created due our handy Annotator, that did the [OpenTelemetry Annotations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/annotations/ ) for us.

- Using nano:
```
nano products/src/main/java/com/shabushabu/javashop/products/resources/ProductResource.java
```

- Search in Nano: `[CTRL]-w`
- Enter in: `999` **[Enter]**

We can see here, someone wrote some very bad code in the form of a long Sleep!

```
if (999==myInt)
  Thread.sleep(
  sleepy.nextInt(5000 - 3000) + 3000);
)
```

# How did we get here ? How did the 999 end up in the trace as a Custom Attribute ?

Take a look at the function signature

`private void myCoolFunction234234234(@SpanAttribute("myInt") int myInt)`

`@SpanAttribute("myint")` is an [OpenTelemetry Annotation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/annotations/) that was added by our Java Otel Annotator tool.

Let's fix our code.

- Change this:

```
private void myCoolFunction234234234(@SpanAttribute("myInt") int myInt) {

// Generate a FAST sleep of 0 time !
Random sleepy = new Random();
try{
if (999==myInt)
Thread.sleep(
sleepy.nextInt(5000 - 3000)
+ 3000);
} catch (Exception e){
```

to this:

```
private void myCoolFunction234234234(@SpanAttribute("myInt") int myInt) {

// Generate a FAST sleep of 0 time !
Random sleepy = new Random();
try{	
// if (999==myInt)
// Thread.sleep(
// sleepy.nextInt(5000 - 3000)	
// + 3000);
} catch (Exception e){
```

which is basically placing comments (`//`) before the lines in `myCoolFunction234234234` that are causing the slowness:
```
// if (999==myInt)
// Thread.sleep(
// sleepy.nextInt(5000 - 3000)
// + 3000);
```

- Save the changes: `[CTRL]-o` **[Enter]**
- Exit: `[CTRL]-x`

**Important Note**: Until we rebuild and restart our application this change isn't implemented.
    
# Let's go see if our manual instrumentation uncovered any other issues we did not see before

So you may be asking yourself: **"How does manual instrumentation alone show us "more problems" than before? Latency is latency, isn't it?"** 

The answer is with auto-instrumentation you are in most situations NOT covering functions our customers' development teams wrote, which is of course the bulk of what developers do. They write functions.... and of course this is where the  bulk of software problems occur. 

You may have noticed a new exception in our trace that was not present with Auto-Instrumentation during our latency fix use-case. Since we skipped over this, let's walk you through it.

- Return to the service map
- Click on `shop` service
- Click **Traces** ( on the right side ) 
- Click **Errors Only**
	
![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 7 36 50 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204348492-84a4ad45-e11c-4e75-a6a9-d6e52e0eb13e.png)

**Important Note**: We haven't changed the code at all by adding annotations.

- Click on a trace with an error present 

![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 7 38 33 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204348687-12241153-b297-4bd7-9ea8-4b410369e82c.png)


We can see our Exception is `InvalidLocaleException`.

The real problem must be related to the new data associated with **Sri Lanka** as the Exception says `"Non English Characters found in Instrument Data"`.

This exception had not surfaced in previous traces based on ONLY Auto-Instrumentation because the method where it was thrown 
was NOT covered with Auto-Instrumentation.

Once we completed the Manual Instrumentation via the Otel Annotator, 
this method was instrumented and we can now see we had a buried Exception being thrown. 

# Let's play Developer once again and fix our issue!

We already know exactly what file to look in and what method to look at as it is called out in the trace.

![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 7 43 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204349038-3b43a5ba-18e3-4d58-8985-29ee1f7da40a.png)

- Using nano:
```
nano shop/src/main/java/com/shabushabu/javashop/shop/model/Instrument.java
```
- Search in Nano: `[CTRL]-w`
- Enter in: `buildForLocale` **[Enter]**

Look just above the `buildForLocale` function, notice the Annotation `@WithSpan`? `@WithSpan` is an [OpenTelemetry Annotation] (https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/annotations/) for Java that automatically generates a span around a the function that follows.

 ![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 7 45 13 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204349143-1e35b6e4-4059-4c56-8718-76c14d41727c.png)

Now let's fix this code. We are going to simply comment this out for now and see if it fixes our latency issue.

- Place comments in front of the entire if statement as follows:

```
if (!isEnglish(title)) {
  throw new InvalidLocaleException("Non English Characters found in Instrument Data");
 } else {
   System.out.println("Characters OK ");
}
```
To this:

```
// if (!isEnglish(title)) {
//   throw new InvalidLocaleException("Non English Characters found in Instrument Data");
// } else {
//   System.out.println("Characters OK ");
// }
```

- Save the changes: `[CTRL]-o` **[Enter]**
- Exit: `[CTRL]-x`

Make sure you saved your changes to shop/src/main/java/com/shabushabu/javashop/shop/model/Instrument.java

# Rebuild and Deploy Application

- Run
```
./BuildAndDeploy.sh
```

We are waiting a few minutes . . .

- Return to the service map

If you do NOT see RED in your service map, you have completed the Latency Repair for the Colorado Location!

Now let's check for our exception in the traces.

- Click on `shop` service
- Click **Traces** ( on the right side ) 
- Click **Errors Only** 

If you do not have red in your service map and you do not see Errors in traces, you have successfully completed our Inventory application review for Sri Lanka and Colorado locations!!! Well done!

# We are nearly done, one more location to go... Chicago

Last, but not least, let's ensure Chicago was on-boarded correctly. However, since we have been having so many issues related to "location" and we have added that custom attribute via Opentelemetry Manual Instrumentation, lets go to the Splunk Observability UI and look at an APM metric set around that tag that I created for us.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/213540265-5b0567ab-c9f3-412f-bec0-07277c7e8650.png)

- Open a browser and navigate to `http://[EC2-Address]:8010`
  - Replace **[EC2-Address]** with the ip address of your host
- Select a few locations and hit the **Login** button.
  - Make sure to also select the **Chicago** Location and hit the **Login** button.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/213541843-30266285-787f-493b-bc90-ffb4ac6e4c77.png)

Uh oh! We received a 500 error, something is wrong there as well. 

![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 8 11 47 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204349595-fca270ad-379e-48c5-b2e1-7f222af82c55.png)

- Return to the Splunk Observability UI and lets look once again at our Service Map
- Select the `Instruments` Service
- Click the `Breakdowns` dropdown on the right and select `location`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/214941419-2eaae297-e246-460b-a913-28c2a28fcd6a.png)


We see there was an un-handled exception thrown in the `Instruments` service, and some latency from our database that is related to the Chicago location!

- Click on Traces on the right
- Click **Errors Only**
- Click one of the traces
	
![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 8 14 50 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204349696-dc19d62f-ed82-4533-ad27-138237821b8e.png)


We can see the exception was thrown by Hibernate, however it was thrown in our method 
`instruments: InstrumentRepository.findInstruments`
	
![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 8 14 37 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204351905-03fe632b-b21c-4e8d-8044-dc582fed2253.png)


# Let's play developer again

Edit the file "instruments: InstrumentRepository.findInstruments"

- Using nano:
```
nano instruments/src/main/java/com/shabushabu/javashop/instruments/repositories/FindInstrumentRepositoryImpl.java
```

- Find the method: `findInstruments`
  - You know how to do this now, right?

![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 8 20 24 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204349802-06135d9d-d70b-4cf1-aaea-3ba737e5c2b9.png)

We can see the developer accidently added the Instruments database with the Chicago Instruments database!

Let's change the query and fix this, remove `instruments_for_sale` from our query.

- Change this:

```
public Object findInstruments() {
  LOGGER.info("findInstruments Called (All)");
  Object obj = entityManager.createNativeQuery( "SELECT * FROM instruments_for_sale, instruments_for_sale_chicago").getResultList(); 
  return obj;
}
```

to This:

```
public Object findInstruments() {
  LOGGER.info("findInstruments Called (All)");
  Object obj = entityManager.createNativeQuery( "SELECT * FROM instruments_for_sale_chicago").getResultList(); 
  return obj;
}
```   

- Save the changes: `[CTRL]-o` **[Enter]**
- Exit: `[CTRL]-x`

# Build and Deploy Application

- Run
```
./BuildAndDeploy.sh
```

Now let's test the Chicago location once again 

- Open a browser and navigate to `http://[EC2-Address]:8010`
- Select the `Chicago` location and `Login`

We now see the 500 error is gone!

Let's confirm a clean Service Map:

![Screen Shot 2022-11-28 at 8 35 11 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32849847/204350088-fca43e3c-42ea-4933-8a61-01eb2083fd23.png)

# If you see a clean service map, free of errors and Latency you have successfully completed the Java Instrumentation Workshop !


# Have a lovely day.
